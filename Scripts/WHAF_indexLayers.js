Using water can reduce stream flows and lake levels, lower groundwater aquifers and impact water quality and water temperature. This index calculates the use of water in a given catchment and its upstream catchments as a percent of the surface water runoff.  Water use is measured as the total annual volume of water (surface and groundwater) reported as used  in the DNR's permits database for each catchment and its upstream catchments.  The amount used is then adjusted for consumptive use based on documented consumptive use coefficients.  Surface water runoff is measured as the mean annual discharge for a catchment and its upstream catchments. Mean annual discharge is estimated using observed annual precipitation and predicted annual runoff coefficients.  Scores are based on a mean of the last 5 years for which data exists. Scores are inversely related to the 'water use vulnerability index', i.e. water use as percent of runoff. A score of 100 is given to catchments with 0 water use, and a score of 0 is given to catchments where average water use exceeds runoff. Watersheds scores represent the mean score of all catchments inside them.
